# genealogy-gedcom
This project is a Computer Science course project from the course known as "The Angel of Death" @ University of Guelph
NOTE!!! that i'm NOT attending University of Guelph, i did NOT take this course. I got the description of the assignment from a guy on reddit

## Before you continue!!!
This is back in development!!!
i'm converting from MySQL database to Oracle.

After i will go serverless. read more about this [here](https://johnpapa.net/shifting-your-node-express-apis-to-serverless/)

### WARNING

This mean that bugs can occur due to commits with half-finished code... ya sorry... i always save to my github
The changes will be in the entire front end, and in the node back-end app.js

So the database is still in the app.js and index.js but is taken down, if you want to use it you can just comment it in and input it in the html again 

the praser will hopefully be left as is.

Just keep this in mind if you are looking at this as inspiration for your project 

## The praser
So this is a GEDCOM file praser, the documentation for GEDCOM can be found [here](http://www.daubnet.com/ftp/gedcom-55-english.pdf)
Decoding and displaying GEDCOM Version, Encoding, submitter name, adress, count etc. 

The praser it self is written in C

## How to use
This is node so you need to install node in the root directory and then start the server like:
### how to.....
```Bash
npm install

# Server  http://localhost:8080
npm run 8080

```
